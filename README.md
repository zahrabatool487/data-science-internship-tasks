# Data Science Internship Tasks

## Task 1: Data Handling with NumPy & Pandas

### Objective
The objective of this task is to build a strong foundation in data handling using NumPy and pandas. The focus is on loading, inspecting, cleaning, and preparing a real-world dataset for further analysis.

### Dataset
- Dataset: Iris Dataset
- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository / GitHub CSV
- Records: 150
- Features: Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal length, Petal width
- Target: Iris species

### Approach
- Loaded the dataset using pandas
- Inspected data using shape, info(), columns, and head()
- Checked and handled missing values
- Identified and removed duplicate records
- Used NumPy for statistical analysis (mean, median, standard deviation)

### Results & Insights
- The dataset was well-structured with no missing values
- Duplicate records were successfully removed
- Feature-wise statistics provided insights into data distribution
- The cleaned dataset is ready for visualization and machine learning models

### Tools & Libraries
- Python
- NumPy
- pandas
- Google Colab
